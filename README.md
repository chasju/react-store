# Online Store Simulation Website

![image](https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/S1W8sVvPO9uz.png?o=1)

Here I have built an online store website, where users can add products to their cart and finally checkout their cart.

## Description

Because this is a simulation there is no need to add payment when checking out the cart. You can try out the website by simply adding products to the cart and then clicking checkout. When doing so the cart will be emptied out.

On this website you should be able to:

- View all products
- View a single product page
- Add product to your cart
- Search products
- Delete products in your cart
- Favorite a product. (As per now this list is only visual and not stored anywhere, and is something that I will implement at a later stage)

## Built With

- CSS modules
- [React.js](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- [Zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/getting-started/introduction)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)

## How to use the project

- Fork the repository.
- Clone the fork to your computer.
- Open it in your preferred editor.

**Initialize git**

```bash
$ git init
```

**Install all dependencies**

```bash
$ npm i
```

### Running

When you first clone the repo you will be in the top level directory, to be able to watch changes in real time you will need to
be in the folder where the entire project is built:

**Change directory**

```bash
$ cd store
```

**Watch changes in real time**

```bash
$ npm run start
```

_See all scripts in package.json file._
